# Traffic Light System

## Descrition

This is a algorithm where it has 4 sets of data, and it decides which is more relevent to its current Situation.

## Functions

> This main algorithem uses a bunch of other Algorithems incluidng:
>
> 1. Bubble sort
> 2. Exchange
> 3. Foreach numbers
>    and much more

## All algorithems

1. Bubble sort (This takes in an array, and sorts the array from smallest to biggest) - DONE
2. Exchange (This takes 2 intagers and exchanges the values from one another) - DONE
3. Foreach Numbers (This will eventually take all the numbers in an array and EXCHANGE them for each other) - NOT DONE
4. Smallest Num (This takes an array and checks which number is the smallest, using an old way, it'll be updates to make it more efficent) - ALMOST DONE
5. Biggest Num (This also takes an array and checks which intager is the biggest, using an old way, it'll also be updated)
6. Equal Num (This also takes an array and checks which 2 intagers have the same value, using an old way, it'll also be updated)
